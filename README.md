###  Quantum Machine Learning Additions:
New commits have introduced quantum image encoding techniques for training QML models. These include:

1. **Quantum Image Encoding with Amplitude Encoding**
   - Encodes classical images into quantum states using amplitude encoding.
   - Efficiently represents images for quantum processing.

2. **Feature Extraction and PCA-based Encoding**
   - Extracts essential features from classical images.
   - Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality before encoding into quantum states.

3. **Quantum Feature Encoding using VGG16 and Amplitude Embedding**
   - Leverages VGG16 for feature extraction.
   - Converts extracted features into quantum states using amplitude embedding.

4. **V4.X â€“ Quantum Image Preprocessing using ORB & PCA with Amplitude Embedding**
   - ORB descriptors are extracted from images for keypoint-based feature extraction.
   - Dimensionality reduced using PCA.
   - Features are amplitude-encoded into quantum states.
   - Suitable for building lightweight QML pipelines using hybrid features.

5. **V5 â€“ Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) with QAOA and Amplitude Feature Embedding**
   - Combines classical feature extraction with quantum embedding and QAOA circuits.
   - Uses amplitude encoding after dimensionality reduction for input features.
   - Trains QCNN models using PennyLane for image classification tasks (e.g., Cats vs Dogs).
   - Supports flexible quantum circuit design with tunable layers and depth.

##  Explanation of Structure:

### Quantum Algorithm Implementations:
Each algorithm (Deutsch's, Deutsch-Josza, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon's) has its own section. This includes:
- **Cell 1**: Defining the quantum device.
- **Cell 2**: Defining the oracle.
- **Cell 3**: Writing the quantum algorithm.
- **Cell 4**: Printing the measurement results.
- **Cell 5**: Drawing the quantum circuit using `draw_mpl`.

### Quantum Image Encoding Modules:
Each encoding technique has its own module, ensuring clear separation and easy integration into QML models.

### Code Snippets:
- Code follows a structured format with comments for each phase of the quantum/classical hybrid process.
